Have you ever wanted to spread a disease that you've created? Well in (insert Name), now you can :).
Play as a player that goes around the maze and infects victims. Enter teleporters and doors, that allow you to teleport across the map and explore new areas. As you walk around the maze and infect individuals, please be careful of the pathfinding robots. The government has heard about your plans, and have sent them out to stop you--how could they?!
