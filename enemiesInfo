The first is be a standard enemy ☿. It will be like a goomba. Small. Weak. No special abilaties. Bad at speling lik me. He is called... a "Einfacher Fiend". strong in numbers

The second is a fast little fello 👿. When you move, he moves 2 spaces. Beacuse he is fast, he will be weak in health and attacking. But if they group up on you, your dead. It is called... "schneller Junge".

The third boi is like a rock 👹. He is strong and powerful in health and attacking. Though he MOVES like a rock. When you move 2 times, he moves once. He is called... "Der Fels der Fels hält den Fels nicht auf".

The 4th little guy is special 🚢. There is only one guy, but he will kill you in one shot. He is the same speed as you, and I suggest you stay out of his way no matter what. He will have lots of health, so you won't survive against this dude. He is called "Bismark", named after the freaking BEAST German Battleship.

The 5th little guy is a guy who can kill other enemies for you, but this little fella is very rare and is very fragile 🕊️. He cannot go up against the bismark, nor Der Fels der Fels hält den Fels nicht auf. He can only defeat the schneller Junge, and maybe the Einfacher Fiend, but he'll have taken a beating by then. "Cher Ami"

The 6th enemy is like a sucicide bomber 💣. He goes up to you, looks you square and the eye, and says, "See you in the great beyond." and sets of an explosion, and that is his attack. Once you get at a certain distance, he explodes. There is a 2 second delay.I'm sorry Benjamin for this advanced code your gonna need to do. He shall be called, "Wir sehen uns im großen Jenseits, Dummkopf".
